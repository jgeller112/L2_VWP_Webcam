abstract: "Eye-tracking has become a valuable tool for studying cognitive processes in second language (L2) acquisition and bilingualism (Godfroid et al., 2024). While research-grade infrared eye-trackers are commonly used, there are a number of isuses that limit its wide-spread adoption. Recently, consumer-based  eye-tracking has emerged as a more affordable alternative, requiring only internet access and a personal webcam. However, webcam eye-tracking presents unique design and preprocessing challenges that must be addressed for valid results. To help researchers overcome these challenges,we developed a comprehensive tutorial focused on using webcam eye-tracking for L2 langauge research (but the information provided can be extended to any online research using the visual world paradigm (VWP)). Our guide will cover all key steps, from experiment design to data preprocessing and analysis, where we highlight the R package `webgazeR`, which is open source and freely available for download and installation: https://github.com/jgeller112/webgazeR. We offer best practices for environmental conditions, participant instructions, and tips for designing VWP experiments with webcam eye-tracking. TO demonstrate these steps, we analyze data collected through the Gorilla platform (Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2020) using a single word Spanish VWP and show competeiton within and between L2/L1. This tutorial aims to empower researchers by providing a step-by-step guide to successfully conduct webcam-based eye-tracking studies.

Eye-tracking technology, which has a history spanning over a century, has seen remarkable advancements. Early techniques were invasive, sometimes requiring the use of contact lenses fitted with search coils—procedures that often necessitated anesthesia [@pluzyczka2018]. Other methods involved suction cups attached to the sclera of the eyes [@yarbus]. Over time, these cumbersome and uncomfortable approaches have given way to non-invasive, lightweight, and user-friendly systems. Today, eye-tracking technology is widely accessible in laboratories worldwide, enabling diverse applications ranging from cognitive neuroscience to consumer behavior research.

Despite its widespread usage, eye-tracking technology faces several obstacles that can limit its accessibility. One significant challenge is the specialized expertise required to operate research-grade eye-trackers. Proper usage often demands many hours of training, meaning most research must be conducted in a lab by a trained student or faculty member. Another major limitation is the cost. Eye-trackers can be prohibitively expensive, ranging from a few thousand dollars (e.g., Gazepoint; www.gazept.com) to tens of thousands of dollars (e.g., Tobii (www.tobii.com; SR Research (www.sr-research.com). As a result, not everyone possess the resources, or the time, to incorporate eye-tracking into their research program.

In addition, eye-tracking research often requires participants to visit a laboratory, which significantly limits the diversity of the sample or population researchers can recruit. Behavioral science research, in general, frequently suffers from a lack of diversity, relying heavily on participants who are predominantly Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic, and able-bodied (WEIRDA). This focus often excludes individuals from geographically dispersed areas, those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, and people with disabilities who may face barriers to accessing research facilities. In language research, this issue is particularly evident, as st often prioritize English-speaking, monolingual, populations [@blasi2022; @bylund2024] and largely includes individuals with typical language production and comprehension abilities. These limitations not only narrow the populations available for study but also compromise the generalizability and applicability of research findings.

## Eye-tracking outside the lab

Methods that allow participants to use their own equipment from anywhere in the world offer a potential solution to the issues outlined above, enabling researchers to recruit more diverse and disadvantaged samples and explore a broader range of questions [@gosling2010]. The shift toward online behavioral experiments has been gradually increasing in the behavioral sciences and has become every more important since the 2020 pandemic, which forced many of us to run studies online [@anderson2019; @rodd2024]. The *onlineification* of behavioral research has prompted the development of eye-tracking methods that do not rely on traditional lab settings. One method, manual eye-tracking \[\@trueswell2008\], involves using video recordings of participants, which can be collected through online teleconferencing platforms such as Zoom (www.zoom.com). After a task completed, eye gaze (direction) is manually analyzed frame by frame from these recordings.

Another method, which is the focus of this tutorial, is automated eye-tracking or webcam eye-tracking. Webcam eye-tracking requires three things: 1. A personal computer. 2. An internet connection and 3. A purchased or pre-installed webcamera. Gaze information can be collected via a web broswer. One common method to perform webcam eye-tracking is through an open source and free to use JavaScript library plugin called WebGazer [@papoutsaki2016]. This plugin is already incorporated into several popular experimental platforms (e.g., *Gorilla*, *jsPsych*, *PsychoPy*, and *PCIbex*; \[@anwyl-irvine2020 @peirce2019; @deleeuw2015; Zehr & Schwarz, [2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11627531/#bib62)) making it extremely easy to start webcam eye-tracking. WebGazer.js utilizes a webcam connected to the internet to track eye movements in real time. It employs a facial feature detection algorithm that estimates the position of the pupils in the webcam stream (relative to the face). By analyzing the relative movement of the eyes, WebGazer.js employs machine learning to estimate the user’s gaze location on the screen.To achieve this, WebGazer uses a dynamic calibration process wherein users look and click on random dot locations on the screen, or follow a dot as it moves to different locations on the screen. This calibration enhances the mapping between eye gaze and on-screen coordinates, ensuring more precise tracking during subsequent tasks.

It is important to note that WebGazer is not the only method available. Other methods have been implemented by companies like Tobii (www.tobii.com) and Labvanced [@kaduk2024] . However, because these methods are proprietary, it is unclear what they are doing under the hood.

The algorithms underlying webcam-based eye tracking differ significantly from those used in research-grade eye trackers. Research-grade systems employ video-based recording and rely on the pupil-corneal reflection (P-CR) method to track gaze with high precision \[@carter2020\]. This method utilizes infrared light to illuminate the eyes, capturing reflections (known as glints) from the cornea and pupil. High-speed cameras simultaneously capture images at rates of hundreds or thousands of frames per second to measure eye position. By combining data from the corneal reflections and pupil location, these systems calculate gaze direction and position. Proprietary algorithms then map this information to specific locations on the screen.

This leads to an important question: how does consumer-grade webcam eye tracking compare to research-grade systems? While validation studies are ongoing, webcam-based eye trackers generally exhibit reduced spatiotemporal accuracy. Studies have reported that these systems achieve spatial accuracy and precision exceeding 1° of visual angle, with latencies ranging from 200 ms to 1000 ms [@semmelmann2018; @slim2023; @slim2024; @kaduk2024]. Furthermore, the sampling rate of webcam-based systems is much lower, typically capped at 60 Hz, with most studies reporting average or median rates around 30 Hz \[\@prystauka2024; \@bramlett2024\]. Unlike research-grade systems, webcam eye trackers do not use infrared light; instead, they rely on ambient light from the participant’s environment. This dependency introduces additional variability in tracking performance.

To compare, research-grade systems like the Tobii Pro Spectrum provides spatial precision of 0.03°–0.06° RMS, spatial accuracy of \<0.3°, and latency of less than 2.5 ms, with a sampling rate of up to 1200 Hz [@nyström2021; @tobii2024]. These advanced metrics make research-grade systems ideal for studies requiring high temporal and spatial resolution.

## Bringing the visual world paradigm online

Despite the differences between research-grade and consumer grade eye-tracking, a number of studies have begun to look at how lab-based results hold up online using webcam eye-tracking. Most relevant to this tutorial are online replications using the visual world paradigm (VWP; [@tanenhaus1995; cf. @cooper1974]). For the past 25 years, the VWP has been a dominant force in language research, helping researchers tackle a wide range of topics, including sentence processing [@eberhard1995], word recognition [@allopenna1998], bilingualism, and the effects of brain damage on language [@mirman2012].

The VWP is a simple task. In a typical VWP experiment, several objects are shown in a display and participants are instructed to point or click on one of the objects. As participants listen to the spoken phrase or word that specifies the target object, their eye movements are recorded. Looks to a given object map very closely and with high temporal precision onto the mental activation of the word or concept corresponding to that object, providing unique insights into the time course of cognitive processing.

Most of the research with the VWP has been conducted in labs with research grade eye-trackers. However, there have been several attempts to conduct these experiments online with webcam eye-tracking. In one of the first studies to examine the VWP in an online setting using webcam eye-tracking, @degen2021 reported a replication of @sun2020 looking at set size and determiners in language processing. In their study, they used a VWP with a carrier phrase that manipulated gender (male vs. female), determiners (i.e., all, some, numeral) and noun. @degen2021 largely replicated the basic pattern of results from @sun2020 observering an interaction between set size and determiners. Most notable, however, is the considerable time delay. Using webcam eye-tracking significant effects did not arise until 700 ms later. They attribted this to reduced spatial precision and lower sampling rates, AOI size, and number of calibrations performed. Several other studies using the VWP online have noted a similar temporal delay in effects [@slim2023; @slim2024].

While the temporal delay reported in these replications presents a significant limitation to using webcam eye-tracking with the VWP, recent developments with WebGazer have improved upon this shortcoming. @vos2022 demonstrated a significant reduction in delay—approximately 50 ms—when comparing the lab-based and online versions of the VWP using an updated version of WebGazer within jsPsych [@deleeuw2015]. More recently, studies by @prystauka2024 and @bramlett2024, leveraging Gorilla and the updated WebGazer algorithm, reported comparable effects between the online and lab-based version of the VWP. These findings highlight that the online version of the VWP, powered by webcam eye-tracking, can achieve results similar to those of traditional lab-based studies.

## Tutorial

Taken together, it seems that webcam eye-tracking is viable alternative to lab-based eye-tracking.Given this, we aimed to support researchers in their efforts to conduct high-quality webcam eye-tracking studies with the VWP. While a valuable tutorial on webcam eye-tracking in the VWP already exists [@bramlett2024], we believe there is value in having multiple resources available to researchers. To this end, we sought to expand on the tutorial by @bramlett2024 by incorporating many of their useful recommendations, but also offering an R package to help streamline data pre-processing.

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide an overview of the basic set-up and design features of an online VWP task using the Gorilla platform [@anwyl-irvine2020] and to highlight the pre-processing steps needed to analyze webcam eye-tracking data. Here we use the popular open source programming language R and introduce the `webgazeR` package [@webgazeR] to facilitate pre-processing of webcam data. To highlight the steps needed to process webcam eye-tracking data we present data from a Spanish spoken word VWP with L2 Spanish speakers. To our knowledge, L2 processing and competitor effects have not been looked at in the online version of the VWP.

# L2 Spanish VWP

To highlight the preprocessing steps required to analyze webcam eye-tracking data, we examined the competitive dynamics of second-language (L2) learners of Spanish during spoken word recognition. Specifically, we investigated both within-language and cross-language (L2/L1) competition using webcam-based eye-tracking.

It is well established that competition plays a critical role in language processing [@magnuson2007]. In speech perception, as the auditory signal unfolds over time, competitors (or cohorts)—phonological neighbors that differ from the target by an initial phoneme—become activated. To successfully recognize the spoken word, these competitors must be inhibited or suppressed. For example, as the word *wizard* in spoken, cohorts like *whistle* might also be briefly activated and in order for wizard to be recognized, *whistle* must be suppressed.

A key question in the L2 literature is whether competition can occur cross-linguistically, with interactions between a speaker’s first language (L1) and second language (L2). A recent study by @sarrett2022 explored this question using carefully designed stimuli to examine within- and cross-linguistic (L2-L1) competition in adult L2 Spanish speakers learners through a cross-linguistic Visual World Paradigm (VWP). Their study included two key conditions

1.  Spanish-Spanish condition: A Spanish competitor was presented alongside the target word. For example, if the target word spoken was "cielo" (sky), the Spanish competitor was "ciencia" (science).

2.  Spanish-English (cross-linguistic) condition: An English competitor was presented for the Spanish target word. For example, if the target word spoken was "botas" (boots), the English competitor was "border."

@sarrett2022 also included a no competition condition where the Spanish-English pairs were not cross-linguistic competitors (e.g., *frontera* as the target word and *botas/boots* as an unrealted item in the pair. They observed competition effects in both of the critical conditions: within-Spanish competition (e.g., *cielo* - *ciencia*) and cross-linguistic competition (e.g., *botas* - *border*). There was no competetion effects in the no competioon condition. For this tutorial, we collected data to conceptually replicate their pattern of findings.

There are two key differences between our dataset and the original study by @sarrett2022. First, @sarrett2022 focused on adult L2 Spanish speakers and posed more fine-grained questions about the time course of competition and resolution and its relationship with L2 language acquisition. Second, unlike McCall et al., who measured Spanish proficiency objectively (e.g., using LexTALE-esp; @izura2014 ), we relied on Prolific’s filters to recruit L2 Spanish speakers.

Our primary goal here was to demonstrate the pre-processing steps required to analyze webcam-based eye-tracking data. A secondary goal was to provide evidence of L2 competition within and between or cross-linguistically using this methodology. To our knowledge, no papers have looked at spoken word recognition and competition using online methods. It is our hope that researchers can use this to test more detailed questions about L2 processing using webcam-based eye-tracking.

### Participants

A total of 187 participants consented to participate in the study using the Gorilla hosting and experiment platform. Of these, 111 passed the headphone screener checkpoint and proceeded to the task. Among these, 32 participants successfully completed the Visual World Paradigm (VWP) task with at least 100 trials, while 79 participants failed calibration. Ninety-one participants completed the entire experiment, including the final questionnaires. @tbl-demo2 provides basic demographic information about the participants who completed the full experiment. After applying additional exclusion criteria (low accuracy (\< 80%) and excessive missing eye-data (\> 30%) , the final sample consisted of 28 participants with usable eye-tracking data.

### Materials

#### VWP

##### Items

We adapted materials from @sarrett2022. In their cross-linguistic VWP, participants were presented with four pictures and a spoken Spanish word and had to select the image that matched the spoken word by clicking on it. The word stimuli for the experiment were chosen from textbooks used by students in their first and second year college Spanish courses.

The item sets consisted of two types of phonologically-related word pairs: one pair of Spanish-Spanish words and another of Spanish-English words. The Spanish-Spanish pairs were unrelated to the Spanish-English pairs. All the word pairs were carefully controlled on a number of dimensions (see [@sarrett2022]).

There were three experimental conditions: (1) the Spanish-Spanish condition, where one of the Spanish words was the target and the other was the competitor; (2) the Spanish-English condition, where a Spanish word was the target and its English phonological cohort served as the competitor; and (3) the No Competitor condition, where the Spanish word did not overlap with any other word in the set. The Spanish-Spanish condition had twice as many trials as the other conditions due to the interchangeable nature of the target and competitor words in that pair.

There were 15 sets of 4 items (half the number of sets used in [@sarrett2022]). Each item within a set was repeated 4 times as the target word. This yielded 240 trials (15 sets × 4 items per set × 4 repetitions). Each item set consisted of one Spanish-Spanish cohort pair and one Spanish-English cohort pair. Both items in a Spanish-Spanish pair had a“reciprocal” competitor relationship (that is, we could test activation for *cielo* given *ciencia*, and for *ciencia* given *cielo*). Consequently, there were 120 trials in the Spanish-Spanish condition. In contrast, only one item from the Spanish-English pair had the speciﬁed competitor relationship (we could test activation for frontera *border*, given *botas*, but when hearing *frontera*, there was no competitor). Thus, there were only 60 trials for each the Spanish-English competition as well as the No Competitor condition. Items occurred in each of the four corners of the screen on an equal numbers of trials.

##### Stimuli

In @sarrett2022 all auditory stimuli were recorded by a female bilingual speaker whose native language was Mexican Spanish and also spoke English. Stimuli were recorded in a sound-attenuated room sampled at 44.1 kHz. Auditory tokens were edited to reduce noise and remove clicks. The auditory tokens were then amplitude normalized to 70 dB SPL. For each target word, there were four separate recordings so each instance was unique.

Visual stimuli were images from a commercial clipart database that were selected by a consensus method involving a small group of students. All .wav files were converted to .mp3 for online data collection. All stimuli can be found here: <https://osf.io/mgkd2/>.

#### Headphone screener

Headphones were required for all participants. To make sure participants where wearing headphones, we used a six-trial task taken from @woods2017. On each trial, three tones of the same frequency and duration were presented sequentially. One tone had a lower amplitude than the other two tones. Tones were presented in stereo, but the tones in the left and right channels were 180 out of phase across stereo channels—in free field, these sounds should cancel out or create distortion, whereas they will be perfectly clear over headphones. The listener picked which of the three tones was the quietest. Performance is generally at the ceiling when wearing headphones but poor when listening in the free field (due to phase cancellation).

#### Demographics questionnaire

Participants completed a demographic questionnaire as part of the study. The questions covered basic demographic information, including age, gender, spoken dialect, ethnicity, and race.

Participants also answered a series of questions related to their personal health and environmental conditions during the experiment. These questions addressed any history of vision problems (e.g., corrected vision, eye disease, or drooping eyelids) and whether they were currently taking medications that might impair judgment. Participants also indicated if they were wearing eyeglasses, contacts, makeup, false eyelashes, or hats.

The questionnaire inquired about their environment, asking if there was natural light in the room, if they were using a built-in camera or an external one (with an option to specify the brand), and their estimated distance from the camera. Participants were asked to estimate how many times they looked at their phone or got up during the experiment and whether their environment was distraction-free.

Additional questions assessed the clarity of calibration instructions, allowing participants to suggest improvements, and asked if they were wearing a mask during the session. These questions aimed to gather insights into personal and environmental factors that could impact data quality and participant comfort during the experiment.

To gauge L2 experience, we asked participants when they started speaking Spanish, how many years of Spanish speaking experience they had, and to provide, on a scale between 0-100, how often they use Spanish in their daily lives.

### Procedure

All tasks were completed in a single session, lasting approximately 45 minutes. The tasks were presented in a fixed order: consent, headphone screener, spoken word VWP, and questionnaire items.

The experiment was programmed in the Gorilla Experiment Platform (Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2019), with personal computers as the only permitted device type. Upon entering the online study, participants received general information to decide if they wished to participate, after which they provided informed consent. Participants were then instructed to adjust the volume to a comfortable level while noise played.

Next, participants completed a headphone screening test. They had three attempts to pass this test. If unsuccessful by the third attempt, participants were directed to an early exit screen, followed by the questionnaire.

For those who passed the screening, the next task was the VWP. This began with instructional videos providing specific guidance on the ideal experiment setup for eye-tracking and calibration procedures. Participants were then required to enter full-screen mode before calibration. Calibration occurred every 60 trials for a total of 3 calibrations. Participants had three attempts to successfully complete each calibration phase. If calibration was unsuccessful, participants were directed to an early exit screen, followed by the questionnaire.

In the main VWP task, each trial began with a 500 ms fixation cross at the center of the screen. This was followed by a preview screen displaying four images, each positioned in a corner of the screen. After 1500 ms, a start button appeared in the center. Participants clicked the button to confirm they were focused on the center before the audio played. Once clicked, the audio was played, and the images remained visible. Participants were instructed to click the image that best matched the spoken target word, while their eye movements were recorded. Eye movements were only recorded on that screen. @fig-vwptrial displays the VWP trial sequence.

```{r}
#| label: fig-vwptrial 
#| fig-cap: VWP trial schematic
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4
#| echo: false


knitr::include_graphics(here::here("_manuscript/Figures/trial_descrip.svg"))

```

After completing the main VWP task, participants proceeded to the final questionnaire, which included questions about the eye-tracking task and basic demographic information. Participants were then thanked for their participation.

## Preprocessing Data

After the data is collected you can begin preprocessing your data. Below we highlight the steps needed to preprocess your webcam eye-tracking data and get it ready for analysis. For some of this preprocessing we will use the newly created `webgazeR`package (v. 0.1.0) which is an extension of the `gazeR` package (Geller et al., 2020) which was created to analyze VWP data in lab-based studies.

For preprocessing webcam eye data, we follow five general steps:

1.  Reading in data
2.  Combining trial- and eye-level data
3.  Assigning areas of interest
4.  Time Binning
5.  Aggregating (optional)

For each of these steps, we will display R code chunks demonstrating how to perform each step with helper functions (if applicable) from the `webgazeR` package in R.

## Reading in Data

### Package Installation and Setup

Before turning to the pre-processing code below, we will need to make sure all the necessary packages are installed. The code will not run if the packages are not installed properly. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead and ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

#### webgazeR installation

The `webgazeR` package can be installed along with helper pack- ages using the remotes package:

```{r}
#| label: webgazer
remotes::install_github("jgeller112/webgazeR")
```

Once this is installed, `webgazeR` can be loaded along with additional useful packages:

```{r}
#| load: packages
options(stringsAsFactors = F) # no automatic data transformation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 10) # suppress math annotation
library(tidyverse) # data wrangling 
library(remotes) # install github repo
library(here) # relative paths instead of abosoulte aids in reproduce
library(tinytable) # nice tables
library(janitor)# functions for cleaning up your column names
library(webgazeR) # has webcam functions
library(readxl) # read in excel files
library(ggokabeito)
library(permuco) # permutation analysis
library(foreach) # permiutation analysis
library(geomtextpath) # for plotting labels on lines of ggplot figs
library(cowplot) # combine ggplot figs

```

Once `webgazeR` and other helper packages have been installed and loaded the user is ready to start preprocessing data.

### Gorilla Data

#### Behavioral, trial-level, data

To process eye-tracking data you will need to make sure you have both the behavioral data and the eye-tracking data files. We have all the data needed in the repository by navigating to the L2 subfolder in the data folder (data -\> L2). For the behavioral data, Gorilla produces a `.csv` file that includes trial-level information (here contained in the object `L2_data)`. The files needed are called `data_exp_196386-v5_task-scf6.csv`. and `data_exp_196386-v6_task-scf6.csv`. We have two files becasue we ran a modified version of the experiment.

The .csv files contain meta-data for each each trial, such as what picture were presented on each trial, which object was the target, reaction times, audio presentation times, what object was clicked on, etc. To load our data files into our R environment, we use the `here` package to set a relative rather than an absolute path to our files. The below object `L2_data` merges both `data_exp_196386-v5_task-scf6.csv` and `data_exp_196386-v6_task-scf6.csv` into one object.

```{r}
#| label: L2 trial data 
# load in trial level data 
# combine data from version 5 and 6 of the task
L2_1 <- read_csv(here("data", "L2", "data_exp_196386-v5_task-scf6.csv"))
L2_2 <- read_csv(here("data", "L2", "data_exp_196386-v6_task-scf6.csv"))
L2_data <- rbind(L2_1, L2_2) # bind the two objects together 
```

#### Eye-tracking data

Gorilla currently saves each participant's eye-tracking data trial by trial. The `raw` subfolder in the data folder in the project repository contains the eye-tracking files by participant for each trial individually. Contained in those files, we have information pertaining to each trial such as participant id,time since trial started, x and y coordinates of looks, convergence (the model’s confidence in finding a face (and accurately predicting eye movements), face confidence (represents the support vector machine (SVM) classifier score for the face model fit), and information pertaining to the the AOI screen coordinates (standardized and user-specific). The `vwp_files_L2` object below contains a list of all the files contained in the folder. Because `vwp_files_L2` contains trial data as well as calibration data, we remove the calibration trials and save the files to `vwp_paths_filtered_L2`.

```{r}
#| label: eye data L2
# Get the list of all files in the folder
vwp_files_L2  <- list.files(here::here("data", "L2", "raw"), pattern = "\\.xlsx$", full.names = TRUE)
# Exclude files that contain "calibration" in their filename
vwp_paths_filtered_L2 <- vwp_files_L2[!grepl("calibration", vwp_files_L2)]
```

When data is generated from Gorilla, each trial in your experiment is saved as an individual file. Because of this, we need some way to take all the individual files and merge them together. The `merge_webcam_files()`function merges each trial from each participant into a single tibble or data frame. Before running the `merge_webcam_files()` function, ensure that your working directory is set to where the files are stored. `merge_webcam_files()` reads in all the .xlsx files from the raw subfolder, binds them together into one dataframe, and cleans up the column names. The function then filters the data to include only rows where the type is "prediction" and the `screen_index` matches the specified value (in our case, screen 4 is where we collected eye-tracking data). If you recorded across multiple screens the `screen_index` argument can take multiple values (e.g., `screen_index`= c(1, 4, 5), will take eye-tacking information from screens, 1, 4, and 5)). `merge_webcam_files()` also renames the `spreadsheet_row` column to trial and sets both `trial` and `subject` as factors for further analysis in our pipeline. As a note, all steps should be followed in order due to the renaming of column names. If you encounter an error it might be because column names have not been changed.

```{r}
#| label: edat L2
#| cache: true
setwd(here::here("data", "L2", "raw")) # set working directory to raw data folder
edat_L2 <- merge_webcam_files(vwp_paths_filtered_L2, screen_index=4) # eye tracking occured ons creen index 4
```

#### Subject and trial level data removal

To ensure high-quality data, it is essential to filter out unreliable data based on both behavioral and eye-tracking criteria before merging datasets. In our dataset, participants will be excluded if they meet any of the following conditions: failure to successfully calibrate throughout the experiment (less than 100 trials), low accuracy ( \< 80%) , low sampling rates ( \< 5), and a high proportion of gaze data outside the screen coordinates ( \> 30%). Successful calibration is crucial for capturing accurate eye-tracking measurements, so participants who could not maintain proper calibration may have inaccurate gaze data. Similarly, low accuracy may indicate poor engagement or task difficulty, which can reduce the reliability of the behavioral data and suggest that eye-tracking data may be less precise.

First, we will create a cleaned up version of our use the behavioral, trial-level, data `L2_data` by creating an object named `eye_behav_L2` that selects useful columns from that file and renames stimuli to make them more intuitive. Because most of this will be user-specific, no function is called here. Below we describe the preprocessing done on the behavioral data file. The below code processes and transforms the `L2_data` dataset into a cleaned and structured format for further analysis. First, the code renames several columns for easier access using `janitor::clean_names()` [@janitor] function. We then select only the columns we need and filter the dataset to include only rows where `zone_type` is "response_button_image", representing the picture selected for that trial. Afterward, the function renames additional columns (`tlpic` to `TL`, `trpic` to `TR`, etc.). We also renamed `participant_private_id` to `subject`, `spreadsheet_row` to `trial`, and `reaction_time` to `RT`. This makes our columns consistent with the `edat` above for merging later on. Lastly, `reaction time` (RT) is converted to a numeric format for further numerical analysis.

It is important to note here that what the behavioral spreadsheet denotes as trial is not in fact the trial number used in the eye-tracking files. Thus it is imperative you use `spreadhseet row` as trial number to merge the two files successfully.

```{r}
#|message: false
#|echo: true
eye_behav_L2 <- L2_data %>%
 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
 
  # Select specific columns to keep in the dataset
  dplyr::select(participant_private_id,  correct, tlpic, trpic, blpic, brpic, condition, eng_targetword, targetword, typetl, typetr, typebl, typebr, zone_name, zone_type,reaction_time, spreadsheet_row,  response) %>%
 
  # Filter the rows where 'Zone.Type' equals "response_button_image"
  dplyr::filter(zone_type == "response_button_image") %>%
 
  # Rename columns for easier use and readability
  dplyr::rename(
    "TL" = "tlpic",              # Rename 'tlpic' to 'TL'
    "TR" = "trpic",             # Rename 'trpic' to 'TR'
    "BL" = "blpic",            # Rename 'blpic' to 'BL'
    "BR" = "brpic",                # Rename 'brpic' to 'BR'
    "targ_loc" = "zone_name",       # Rename 'Zone.Name' to 'targ_loc'
    "subject" = "participant_private_id",  # Rename 'Participant.Private.ID' to 'subject'
    "trial" = "spreadsheet_row",    # Rename 'spreadsheet_row' to 'trial'
    "acc" = "correct",              # Rename 'Correct' to 'acc' (accuracy)
    "RT" = "reaction_time"          # Rename 'Reaction.Time' to 'RT'
  ) %>%
 
  # Convert the 'RT' (Reaction Time) column to numeric type
  mutate(RT = as.numeric(RT),
         subject=as.factor(subject),
         trial=as.factor(trial))

```

### Audio onset

Because we are using spoken audio on each trial and running this experiment from the browser, audio onset is never going to to consistent across participants. In Gorilla there is an option to collect advanced audio features (you must make sure you select this when designing the study) such as when the audio play was requested, fired (played) and when the audio ended. To do so you must click on advanced settings and select 1 (see @fig-audiopres). We will want to incorporate this timing information into our analysis pipeline. Gorilla records the onset of the audio which varies by participant. We are extracting that in the `audio_rt_L2` object by filtering `zone_type` to `content_web_audio` and response equal to "AUDIO PLAY EVENT FIRED". This will tell us when the audio was triggered in the experiment. We are creating a column called (`RT_audio`) which we will use later on to correct for audio delays.

```{r}
#| label: fig-audiopres
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("_manuscript", "Figures", "audio_settings.jpg"))
```

```{r}
#| label: audio onset L2
audio_rt_L2 <- L2_data %>%
 
  janitor::clean_names()%>%

select(participant_private_id,zone_type, spreadsheet_row, reaction_time, response) %>%

  filter(zone_type=="content_web_audio", response=="AUDIO PLAY EVENT FIRED")%>%
  distinct() %>%
dplyr::rename("subject" = "participant_private_id",
       "trial" ="spreadsheet_row",  
       "RT_audio" = "reaction_time") %>%
select(-zone_type) %>%
mutate(RT_audio=as.numeric(RT_audio))

```

We then merge this information with `eye_behav_L2`.

```{r}
#| label: L2-merge-audio

# merge the audio Rt data to the trial level object
trial_data_rt_L2 <- merge(eye_behav_L2, audio_rt_L2, by=c("subject", "trial"))

```

### Trial removal

As stated above, participants who did not successfully calibrate 3 times or less were rejected from the experiment. Let's take a look at how many trials each participant had using the `trial_data_rt_L2` object. Deciding to remove trials is ultimately up to the researcher. In our case, we remoced participans who have less than 100 trials. In @tbl-partL2 we can see several participants failed some of the calibration attempts and do not have an adequate number of trials. Again we make no strong recommendations here. If you to decide to do this, we recommend pre-registrating this decision.

```{r}
# find out how many trials each participant had
edatntrials_L2 <-trial_data_rt_L2 %>%
 dplyr::group_by(subject)%>%
 dplyr::summarise(ntrials=length(unique(trial)))
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-partL2
#| tbl-cap: Trials by participant Experiment 2
#| echo: false

edatntrials_L2 %>%
  tt() %>%
  save_tt(here::here("_manuscript", "Figures", "edatntrialsL2.png"), overwrite = TRUE)

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("_manuscript", "Figures", "edatntrialsL2.png"))


```

```{r}
#| label: badsubsL2
#| echo: false
# get bad subs and remove them the analysis

edatntrials_bad_L2 <-trial_data_rt_L2 %>%
 dplyr::group_by(subject)%>%
 dplyr::summarise(ntrials=length(unique(trial))) %>%
  dplyr::filter(ntrials > 100)
  
```

Let's remove them from the analysis using the below code.

```{r}
#| label: remove bads L2

trial_data_rt_L2 <- trial_data_rt_L2 %>%
  filter(subject %in% edatntrials_bad_L2$subject)

```

### Low accuracy

In our experiment, we want to make sure accuracy is high (\> 80%). Again, we want participants that are fully attentive in the experiment. In the below code, we keep participants with accuracy equal to or above 80% and only include correct trials and save it to `trial_data_acc_clean_L2`.

```{r}
#| label: accuracy-L2

# Step 1: Calculate mean accuracy per subject and filter out subjects with mean accuracy < 0.8
subject_mean_acc_L2 <- trial_data_rt_L2 %>%
  group_by(subject) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mean_acc = mean(acc, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(mean_acc > 0.8)

# Step 2: Join the mean accuracy back to the main dataset and exclude trials with accuracy < 0.8
trial_data_acc_clean_L2 <- trial_data_rt_L2 %>%
  inner_join(subject_mean_acc_L2, by = "subject") %>%
  filter(acc==1) # only use accurate responses for fixation analysis

```

### RTs

There is much debate on what the proper procedure is to use to remove RTs that will bias the data the least, and if they should even be removed. Because of the ambiguity We do not remove RTs in this experiment.

### Sampling Rate

While most commercial eye-trackers sample at a constant rate, data captured by webcams are widely inconsistent. Below is some code to calculate the sampling rate of each participant. Ideally, you should not have a sampling rate less than 5 Hz. It has been recommended you drop those values [@bramlett2024] The below function `analyze_sample_rate()` calculates calculates the sampling rate for each subject and each trial in our eye-tracking dataset (`edat_L2`). The function provides overall statistics, including the median (used by [@bramlett2024]) and standard deviation of sampling rates in your experiment,and also generates a histogram of median sampling rates by subject. Looking at @fig-samprate-L2, the sampling rate ranges from 5 to 35 Hz with a median sampling rate of 21.56. This corresponds to previous webcam eye-tracking work (e.g., [@prystauka2024; @bramlett2024])

```{r}
#| label: fig-samprate-L2
#| fig-cap: Participant sampling-rate for L2 experiment. A histogram and overlayed density plot shows median sampling rate by participant. the overall median and SD is highlighted in red.
#| echo: true

samp_rate_L2 <- analyze_sampling_rate(edat_L2)
```

When using the above function, separate dataframes are produced by-participants and by-trial. These can be added to the behavioral dataframe using the below code.

```{r}
# Extract by-subject and by-trial sampling rates from the result
subject_sampling_rate_L2 <- samp_rate_L2$median_SR_by_subject  # Sampling rate by subject
trial_sampling_rate_L2 <- samp_rate_L2$SR_by_trial  # Sampling rate by trial
trial_sampling_rate_L2$subject<-as.factor(trial_sampling_rate_L2$subject)

# Assuming target_data is your other dataset that contains subject and trial information
# Append the by-subject sampling rate to target_data (based on subject)
subject_sampling_rate_L2$subject <- as.factor(subject_sampling_rate_L2$subject)

# Assuming target_data is your other dataset that contains subject and trial information
# Append the by-subject sampling rate to target_data (based on subject)
trial_sampling_rate_L2$subject<-as.factor(trial_sampling_rate_L2$subject)

# Assuming target_data is your other dataset that contains subject and trial information
# Append the by-subject sampling rate to target_data (based on subject)
subject_sampling_rate_L2$subject <- as.factor(subject_sampling_rate_L2$subject)
trial_data_acc_clean_L2$subject <- as.factor(trial_data_acc_clean_L2$subject)

target_data_with_subject_SR_L2 <- trial_data_acc_clean_L2 %>%
  left_join(subject_sampling_rate_L2, by = "subject")

target_data_with_subject_SR_L2$trial <- as.factor(target_data_with_subject_SR_L2$trial)

# Append the by-trial sampling rate to target_data (based on subject and trial)
target_data_with_full_SR_L2 <- target_data_with_subject_SR_L2 %>%
  select(subject, trial, med_SR)%>%
  full_join(trial_sampling_rate_L2, by = c("subject", "trial"))

```

```{r}
trial_data_L2 <- left_join(trial_data_acc_clean_L2, target_data_with_full_SR_L2, by=c("subject", "trial"))

```

Now we can use this information to filter out data with poor sampling rates. Users can use the `filter_sampling_rate()` function to either (1) throw out data, by-participant, by-trial, or both, or (2) label sampling rates below a certain threshold as bad (TRUE or FALSE). Let's use the `filter_sampling_rate()` function to do this. We will use our `trial_data_L2` object.

We leave it up to the user to decide what to do with low sampling rates and make no specific recommendations here. In our case we are going to remove the data by-participant and by-trial (setting `action` = "both" ) if sampling frequency is below 5hz (`threshold`=5). The `filter_sampling_rate()` function is designed to process a dataset containing participant-level and trial-level sampling rates. It allows the user to either filter out data that falls below a certain sampling rate threshold or simply label it as “bad”. The function gives flexibility by allowing the threshold to be applied at the participant-level, trial-level, or both. It also lets the user decide whether to remove the data or flag it as below the threshold without removing it. If `action` = remove, the function will output how many subjects and trials were removed by on the threshold.

```{r}
filter_edat_L2 <- filter_sampling_rate(trial_data_L2,threshold = 5,
                                         action = "remove",
                                         by = "both")

```

The message produced states that 1 subject is thrown out along with 107 trials (trials associated with the 1 subject).

### Out-of-bounds (outside of screen)

It is important that we do not include points that fall outside the standardized coordinates (0,1). The `gaze_oob()` function calculates how many of the data points fall outside the standardized range. Here we need our eye-tracking data (`edat_L2`). Running the `gaze_oob()` function returns a table listing how many data points fall outside this range (total, X and Y), and also provides percentages (see @tbl-oob-L2). This information would be useful to include in the final paper.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| results: hide
#| 
oob_data_L2 <- gaze_oob(edat_L2)
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-oob-L2
#| tbl-cap: Out of bounds gaze statistics
#| echo: false

oob_data_L2 %>%
  tt() %>%
  save_tt(here::here("_manuscript","Figures", "oob_data_L2.png"), overwrite=TRUE)


knitr::include_graphics(here::here("_manuscript", "Figures", "oob_data_L2.png"))

```

We can also add add by-participant and by-trial out of bounds data to our behavioral, trial-level, data (`filter_edat_L2`) and finally exclude participants and trials with more than 30% missing data. The value of 30 is just a suggestion and should not be used as a rule of thumb for all studies nor are we endorsing this value.

```{r}

remove_missing <- oob_data_L2 %>%                             # Start with the `oob_data` dataset and assign the result to `remove_missing`
  select(subject, total_missing_percentage) %>%            # Select only the `subject` and `total_missing_percentage` columns from `oob_data`
  left_join(filter_edat_L2, by = "subject") %>%               # Perform a left join with `filter_edat` on the `subject` column, keeping all rows from `oob_data`
  filter(total_missing_percentage < 30)  %>%                   # Filter the data to keep only rows where `total_missing_percentage` is less than 30 %>%
na.omit()

```

## Eye-tracking data

### Convergence and confidence

In the eye-tracking data we need to remove rows with poor convergence and confidence scores in our eye-tracking data. The `convergence` column refers to WebGazer.js confidence in finding a face (and accurately predicting eye movements). Confidence values vary from 0 to 1, and numbers less than 0.5 suggest that the model has probably converged. `face_conf` represents the support vector machine (SVM) classifier score for the face model fit. This score indicates how strongly the image under the model resembles a face. Values vary from 0 to 1, and here numbers greater than 0.5 are indicative of a good model fit. In our `edat_L2` object we filter out convergence less than 0.5 and face confidence greater than 0.5 and save it to `edat_1_L2`

```{r}
edat_1_L2 <- edat_L2 %>%
 dplyr::filter(convergence <= .5, face_conf >= .5) # remove poor convergnce and face confidence

```

### Combining eye and trial-level data

Next, we will combine the eye-tracking data and behavioral data. In this case, we’ll use right_join to add the behavioral data to the eye-tracking data. This ensures that all rows from the eye-tracking data are preserved, even if there isn’t a matching entry in the behavioral data (missing values will be filled with NA). The resulting object is called dat_L2. We use the `distinct()` function afterward to remove any duplicate rows that may arise during the join

```{r}

dat_L2 <- right_join(edat_1_L2,remove_missing,  by = c("subject","trial"))

dat_L2 <- dat_L2 %>%
  distinct() # make sure to remove duplicate rows

```

## Areas of Interest

### Zone coordinates

In the lab, we can control every aspect of the experiment. Online we cant do this. Participants are going to be completing the experiment under a variety of conditions. This includes using different computers, with very different screen dimensions. To control for this, Gorilla outputs standardized zone coordinates (labeled as `x_pred_normalised` and `y_pred_normalised` in the eye-tracking file) . As discussed in the Gorilla documentation, the Gorilla lays everything out in a 4:3 frame and makes that frame as big as possible. The normalized coordinates are then expressed relative to this frame; for example, the coordinate 0.5, 0.5 will always be the center of the screen, regardless of the size of the participant’s screen. We used the normalized coordinates in our analysis (in general, you should always use normalized coordinates). However, there are a few different ways to specify the four coordinates of the screen, which I think are worth highlighting here.

#### Quadrant approach

One way is to make the AOIs as big as possible, dividing the screen into four quadrants. This approach has been used in several studies (e.g., [@bramlett2024; @prystauka2024] ). @tbl-quads-L2 lists coordinates for the quadrant approach. @fig-quads shows how each quadrant looks in standardized space.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-quads-L2
#| tbl-cap: Screen coordinates for quadrant appraoch
#| echo: false
# Create a data frame for the quadrants with an added column for the quadrant labels
aoi_loc <- data.frame(
  loc = c('TL', 'TR', 'BL', 'BR'), 
  x_normalized = c(0, 0.5, 0, 0.5),
   y_normalized = c(0.5, 0.5, 0, 0),
  width_normalized = c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
  height_normalized = c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)) %>% 
  
  mutate(xmin = x_normalized, ymin = y_normalized,
         xmax = x_normalized+width_normalized,
         ymax = y_normalized+height_normalized)


aoi_loc %>% 
  tt() %>% 
   save_tt(here::here("_manuscript","Figures", "aoi-quad.png"), overwrite=TRUE)


knitr::include_graphics(here::here("_manuscript", "Figures", "aoi-quad.png"))
```

We plot all the fixations in each of the quadrants highlighted in different colors (@fig-quads), removing points outside the standardized screen space.

```{r}
#| label: fig-quads
#| fig-cap: AOI coordiantes in standardized space using the quandrant appraoch
#| echo: false
#|

#look at the AOIs and see if they make sense

# Create a data frame for the quadrants
quadrants <- data.frame(
  x = c(0, 0.5, 0, 0.5),
  y = c(0.5, 0.5, 0, 0),
  width = c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
  height = c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
  color = c('red', 'blue', 'green', 'orange'),
  label = c('TL Width = 0.5', 'TR Width = 0.5', 'BL Width = 0.5', 'BR Width = 0.5')
)

# Create the plot
ggplot() +
  geom_rect(data = quadrants, aes(xmin = x, xmax = x + width, ymin = y, ymax = y + height, fill = color),
            color = 'black', alpha = 0) +
  geom_text(data = quadrants, aes(x = x + width/2, y = y + height/2, label = label), color = 'black', size = 5) +
  scale_fill_identity() +
  coord_fixed() +
  labs(x = 'Normalized X', y = 'Normalized Y', title = 'Quadrants with Width Annotations') +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-fixquads
#| fig-cap: All looks in each of the screen quadrants

We plot all the fixations in each of the quadrants highlighted in different colors (@fig-quads), removing points outside the standardized screen space. As a note, we have decided to use an outer edge approach here (eliminating eye fixations that extend beyond the screen coordinates). @bramlett2024 have suggested an inner-edge approach and we may add this functionality once more testing is done. For now, we believe that the otter edge approach leads to the least amount of bias in the eye-tracking pipeline.

##### Matching conditions with screen locations

The goal of the provided code is to assign condition codes (e.g., Target, Unrelated, Unrelated2, and Cohort) to each image in the dataset based on the screen location where the image is displayed (e.g., TL, TR, BL, BR).

For each trial, the images are dynamically placed at different screen locations, and the code maps each image to its corresponding condition based on these locations.

```{r}

# Assuming your data is in a data frame called dat_L2
dat_L2 <- dat_L2 %>%
  mutate(
    Target = case_when(
      typetl == "target" ~ TL,
      typetr == "target" ~ TR,
      typebl == "target" ~ BL,
      typebr == "target" ~ BR,
      TRUE ~ NA_character_  # Default to NA if no match
    ),
    Unrelated = case_when(
      typetl == "unrelated1" ~ TL,
      typetr == "unrelated1" ~ TR,
      typebl == "unrelated1" ~ BL,
      typebr == "unrelated1" ~ BR,
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    ),
    Unrelated2 = case_when(
      typetl == "unrelated2" ~ TL,
      typetr == "unrelated2" ~ TR,
      typebl == "unrelated2" ~ BL,
      typebr == "unrelated2" ~ BR,
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    ),
    Cohort = case_when(
      typetl == "cohort" ~ TL,
      typetr == "cohort" ~ TR,
      typebl == "cohort" ~ BL,
      typebr == "cohort" ~ BR,
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    )
  )


```

In addition to tracking the condition of each image during randomized trials, a custom function, `find_location()`, determines the specific screen location of each image by comparing it against the list of possible locations. This function ensures that the appropriate location is identified or returns NA if no match exists. Specifically, `find_location()` first checks if the image is NA (missing). If the image is NA, the function returns NA, meaning that there's no location to find for this image. If the image is not NA, the function creates a vector called loc_names that lists the names of the possible locations. It then attempts to match the given image with the locations. If a match is found, it returns the name of the location (e.g., TL, TR, BL, or BR) of the image.

```{r}

# Apply the function to each of the targ, cohort, rhyme, and unrelated columns
dat_colnames_L2 <- dat_L2 %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    targ_loc = find_location(c(TL, TR, BL, BR), Target),
    cohort_loc = find_location(c(TL, TR, BL, BR), Cohort),
    unrelated_loc = find_location(c(TL, TR, BL, BR), Unrelated), 
    unrealted2_loc= find_location(c(TL, TR, BL, BR), Unrelated2), 
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

```

Once we do this we can use `assign_aoi()` to loop through our object called `dat_colnames_L2` and assign locations (i.e., TR, TL, BL, BR) to where participants looked at on the screen. This requires the `x` and `y` coordinates and the location of our aois `aoi_loc`. Here we are using the quadrant approach. This function will label non-looks and off screen coordinates with NA. To make it easier to read we change the numerals assigned by the function to actual screen locations (e.g., TL, TR, BL, BR).

```{r}

assign_L2 <- gazer::assign_aoi(dat_colnames_L2,X="x_pred_normalised", Y="y_pred_normalised",aoi_loc = aoi_loc)


AOI_L2 <- assign_L2 %>%

  mutate(loc1 = case_when(

    AOI==1 ~ "TL", 

    AOI==2 ~ "TR", 

    AOI==3 ~ "BL", 

    AOI==4 ~ "BR"

  ))
```

In `AOI_L2` we label looks to Targets, Unrelated, and Cohort items with 1 (looked) and 0 (no look).

```{r}
AOI_L2$target <- ifelse(AOI_L2$loc1==AOI_L2$targ_loc, 1, 0) # if in coordinates 1, if not 0. 

AOI_L2$unrelated <- ifelse(AOI_L2$loc1 == AOI_L2$unrelated_loc, 1, 0)# if in coordinates 1, if not 0. 

AOI_L2$unrelated2 <- ifelse(AOI_L2$loc1 == AOI_L2$unrealted2_loc, 1, 0)# if in coordinates 1, if not 0. 

AOI_L2$cohort <- ifelse(AOI_L2$loc1 == AOI_L2$cohort_loc, 1, 0)# if in coordinates 1, if not 0. 

```

The locations of looks need to be “gathered” or pivoted into long format—that is, converted from separate columns into a single column. This transformation makes the data easier to visualize and analyze. We use the `pivot_longer()` function from the `tidyverse` to combine the columns (Target, Unrelated, Unrelated2, and Cohort) into a single column called `condition1`. Additionally, we create another column called `Looks`, which contains the values from the original columns (e.g., 0 or 1 for whether the area was looked at).

```{r}

dat_long_aoi_me_L2 <- AOI_L2 %>%
  select(subject, trial, condition, target, cohort, unrelated, unrelated2, time, x_pred_normalised, y_pred_normalised, RT_audio) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(target, unrelated, unrelated2, cohort),
    names_to = "condition1",
    values_to = "Looks"
  )

```

We frirther clean up the object by first cleaning up the condition codes. They have a numeral appended to them and that should be removed. We then adjust the timing in the `gaze_sub_L2_comp` object by aligning time to the actual audio onset. To achieve this, we subtract `RT_audio` from time for each trial. In addition, we subtract 300 ms from this to account for the 100 ms of silence at the beginning of each audio clip and 200 ms to account for the oculomotor delay when planning an eye movement @viviani1990. Additionally, we set our interest period between 0 ms (audio onset) and 2000 ms. This was chosen based on the time course figures in @sarrett2022 . It is important that you choose your interest area carefully and preferably you preregister it. The interest period you choose can have drastic We also filter out gaze coordinates that fall outside the standardized window, ensuring only valid data points are retained. The resulting object `gaze_sub_long_L2` provides the corrected time column spanning from -200 ms to 2000 ms relative to stimulus onset with looks outside the screen removed.

```{r}
# repalce the numbers appended to conditions that somehow got added 
dat_long_aoi_me_comp <- dat_long_aoi_me_L2 %>%
  mutate(condition = str_replace(condition, "TCUU-SPENG\\d*", "TCUU-SPENG")) %>%
  mutate(condition = str_replace(condition, "TCUU-SPSP\\d*", "TCUU-SPSP"))%>% 
  na.omit() 

```

```{r}

# dat_long_aoi_me_comp has condition corrected 

gaze_sub_L2_long <-dat_long_aoi_me_comp%>% 
group_by(subject, trial, condition) %>%
  mutate(time = (time-RT_audio)-300) %>% # subtract audio rt onset and account for occ motor planning and silence in audio
 filter(time >= -200, time < 2000) %>% 
   dplyr::filter(x_pred_normalised > 0,
                x_pred_normalised < 1,
                y_pred_normalised > 0,
                y_pred_normalised < 1)

```

## Samples to bins

## Downsampling

Downsampling into smaller time bins is a common practice in gaze data analysis, as it helps create a more manageable dataset and reduces noise. When using research grade eye-trackers, it is sometimes not needed to downsample the data. However, with consumer-based webcam eye-tracking it is recommended you downsample your data so participants have consistent bin sizes (e.g., [@slim2023]). In `webgazeR` we included the `downsample_gaze()` function to assist with this process. We apply this function to the `gaze_sub_L2_long` object,and set the `bin.length` argument to 100, which groups the data into 100-millisecond intervals. This adjustment means that each bin now represents a 100 ms passage of time. We specify time as the variable to base these bins on, allowing us to focus on broader patterns over time rather than individual millisecond fluctuations.There is no agreed upon downsampling value, but with webcam data larger bins are preferred [@slim2023].

In addition, we indicate other variables for aggregation, such as condition, and use the newly created timebins variable, which represents the time intervals over which we aggregate data. There is no universal rule for selecting bin sizes, but @bramlett2024 found that differences in bin size did not significantly affect results as long as the sampling rate was above 5 Hz. The resulting downsampled dataset, output as @tbl-agg-sub, provides a simplified and more concise view of gaze patterns, making it easier to analyze and interpret broader trends.

```{r}

gaze_sub_L2 <- downsample_gaze(gaze_sub_L2_long, bin.length=100, timevar="time", aggvars=c("condition", "condition1", "time_bin"))

```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-agg-sub
#| tbl-cap: Aggregated proportion looks for each condition in each 100 ms time bin
#| echo: false

gaze_sub_L2 %>%
  head() %>%
  tt()

```

To simplify the analysis, we combine the two unrelated conditions and average them (this is for the proprotional plots).

```{r}

# Average Fix for unrelated and unrelated2, then combine with the rest
gaze_sub_L2 <- gaze_sub_L2 %>%
    group_by(condition, time_bin) %>%
    summarise(
        Fix = mean(Fix[condition1 %in% c("unrelated", "unrelated2")], na.rm = TRUE),
        condition1 = "unrelated",  # Assign the combined label
        .groups = "drop"
    ) %>%
    # Combine with rows that do not include unrelated or unrelated2
    bind_rows(gaze_sub_L2 %>% filter(!condition1 %in% c("unrelated", "unrelated2")))

```

The above will not include the subject variable. If you want to keep participant-level data we need to add `subject` to the `aggvars` argument. If you do not plan to analyze proportion data, and instead what time binned data with binary outcomes preserved please set the `aggvars` argument to "none." This will return a time binned column but will not aggregate over other variables.

```{r}

# get back trial level data with no aggregation

gaze_sub_id <- downsample_gaze(gaze_sub_L2_long, bin.length=100, timevar="time", aggvars="none")

```

We need to make sure we only have one unrelated value.

```{r}

gaze_sub_id <- gaze_sub_id %>% 
  mutate(condition1 = ifelse(condition1=="unrelated2", "unrelated", condition1))

```

In `AOI_L2` we label looks to Targets, Unrelated, and Cohort items with 1 (looked) and 0 (no look).

```{r}
AOI_L2$target <- ifelse(AOI_L2$loc1==AOI_L2$targ_loc, 1, 0) # if in coordinates 1, if not 0. 

AOI_L2$unrelated <- ifelse(AOI_L2$loc1 == AOI_L2$unrelated_loc, 1, 0)# if in coordinates 1, if not 0. 

AOI_L2$unrelated2 <- ifelse(AOI_L2$loc1 == AOI_L2$unrealted2_loc, 1, 0)# if in coordinates 1, if not 0. 

AOI_L2$cohort <- ifelse(AOI_L2$loc1 == AOI_L2$cohort_loc, 1, 0)# if in coordinates 1, if not 0. 

```

The locations of looks need to be “gathered” or pivoted into long format—that is, converted from separate columns into a single column. This transformation makes the data easier to visualize and analyze. We use the pivot_longer() function to combine the columns (Target, Unrelated, Unrelated2, and Cohort) into a single column called condition1. Additionally, we create another column called Looks, which contains the values from the original columns (e.g., 0 or 1 for whether the area was looked at).

```{r}

dat_long_aoi_me_L2 <- AOI_L2  %>%
  select(subject, trial, condition, target, cohort, unrelated, unrelated2, time, x_pred_normalised, y_pred_normalised, RT_audio) %>%
    pivot_longer(
        cols = c(target, unrelated, unrelated2,cohort),
        names_to = "condition1",
        values_to = "Looks"
    )

```

## Samples to bins

We can further clean up the data to improve its accuracy and relevance. Since there is a delay in audio presentation, captured as `RT_audio` in our dataset, we adjust the timing in the `gaze_sub_L2_comp` dataset by aligning time to the actual audio onset. To achieve this, we subtract `RT_audio` from time for each trial. In addition, we subtract 300 ms from this to account for the 100 ms of silence at the beginning of each audio clip and 200 ms to account for the oculomotor delay when planning an eye movement @viviani1990. Additionally, we set our interest period between 0 ms (audio onset) and 2000 ms. This was chosen based on the time course figures in @sarrett2022 .

  mutate(condition = str_replace(condition, "TCUU-SPENG\\d*", "TCUU-SPENG")) %>%
  mutate(condition = str_replace(condition, "TCUU-SPSP\\d*", "TCUU-SPSP"))%>% 
  na.omit() 

```

```{r}

# dat_long_aoi_me_comp has condition corrected 

gaze_sub_L2_long <-dat_long_aoi_me_comp%>% 
group_by(subject, trial, condition) %>%
  mutate(time = (time-RT_audio)-300) %>% # subtract audio rt onset and account for occ motor planning and silence in audio
 filter(time >= -200, time < 2000) %>% 
   dplyr::filter(x_pred_normalised > 0,
                x_pred_normalised < 1,
                y_pred_normalised > 0,

## Visualizing time course data

To simplify plotting your time-course data, we have created the `plot_IA_proportions()` function. This function takes several arguments. The `ia_column` argument specifies the column containing your Interest Area (IA) labels. The `time_column` argument requires the name of your time bin column, and the `proportion_column` argument specifies the column containing fixation or look proportions. Additional arguments allow you to specify custom names for each IA in the `ia_mapping` argument, enabling you to label them as desired. In order to use this function, you must use the `downsample_gaze()` function.

Below we have plotted the time course data in @fig-L2comp for each condition. By default the graphs are using a color-blind friendly palette from the `ggokabeito` package [@ggokabeito].

```{r}
#| label: fig-L2comp
#| fig-cap: "Comparison of L2 competition effects."
#| fig-width: 12
#| echo: false

tcru <- plot_IA_proportions(
    gaze_sub_L2, 
    ia_column = "condition1",
    time_column = "time_bin",
    proportion_column = "Fix",
    condition_column = "condition", 
    ia_mapping = list(target = "Target", cohort = "Cohort", unrelated = "Unrelated")
) + 
    facet_wrap(
        ~ condition,             # Facet by condition
        labeller = labeller(
            condition = c(
                "TCUU-ENGSP" = "No Competitor",
                "TCUU-SPENG" = "Spanish-English",
                "TCUU-SPSP" = "Spanish-Spanish"
            )
        ),
        ncol = 2                # Specify 2 columns to achieve 2 on top row, 1 on bottom
    ) +
    labs(tag = c("a", "b", "c")) +         # Optional tag for labeling
    theme(
        strip.text = element_text(size = 14),  # Adjust facet label text size
        panel.spacing = unit(1, "lines")       # Add space between panels
    )

# Print the plot
tcru
```

#### Gorilla provided coordinates

Thus far, we have used the coordinates representing the four quadrants of the screen. However, Gorilla provides their own quadrants representing image location on the screen. To the authors' knowledge, these quadrants have not been looked at in any studies reporting eye-tracking results. Let's examine how reasonable our results are with these coordinates.

```{r}
#| label: eye data gorilla L2
#| echo: false
# Get the list of all files in the folder
vwp_files_L2  <- list.files(here::here("data", "L2", "raw"), pattern = "\\.xlsx$", full.names = TRUE)

# Exclude files that contain "calibration" in their filename
vwp_paths_filtered_L2 <- vwp_files_L2[!grepl("calibration", vwp_files_L2)]

```

We will use the function `extract_aois` to get the standardized coordinates for each quadrant on screen. You can use the `zone_names` argument to get the zones you want to use. In our case we want the `TL`, `BR`, `BL` `TR` coordinates. We input our object that contains all our eye-tracking files and this extract the coordinates. These are labled in @tbl-gorgaze. In @fig-gor-L2 we can see that the AOIs are a bit smaller than then when using the quadrant approach. We can take these coordinates and use them in our analysis.

We are not going to highlight the steps here as they are the same as above. we are just repalcing hre coordinates.

```{r}
#| cache: true
# apply the extract_aois fucntion
aois_L2 <- extract_aois(vwp_paths_filtered_L2, zone_names =  c("TL", "BR", "TR", "BL"))

## Modeling Data

When analyzing VWP data there are many analytic approaches to choose from (e.g., growth curve analysis (GCA), cluster permutation tests (CPT), generalized additive mixed models (GAMMS), logistic multilevel models, divergent point analysis, etc.), and a lot has already been written describing these methods and applying them to visual world fixation data from the lab (see [@stone2021; @ito2023; @mcmurray ) and online ([@bramlett2024]). This tutorial's goal, however, is to not evaluate different analytic approaches and tell readers which is the best method. All methods have there strengths and weaknesses [@ito2023]. Nevertheless, statistical modeling should be guided by the questions researchers using the VWP have and thus serious thought needs to be given to the proper analysis. In the VWP, there are two general questions one might be interested in: (1) Are there any overall difference in fixations between conditions and (2) Are there any time course differences in fixations between conditions.

With our data, one question we might want to answer is if there are any fixation differences between the cohort and unrelated conditions across the time course. One statistical approach we chose to highlight to answer this question is a cluster permutation analysis (CPA). The CPA is suitable for testing differences between two conditions or groups over an interest period while controlling for multiple comparisons and autocorrelation.

## CPT

CPA is a technique that has become increasingly popular, particularly in the field of cognitive neuropsychology, for analyzing MEG and EEG data [@maris2007]. While its adoption in VWP studies has been relatively slow, it is now beginning to appear more frequently [@ito2023; @huang2020]. Notably, its use is growing in online eye-tracking studies (see \[@slim2023; @slim2024; @vos2022).

Before I show you how to apply this method to the current dataset, I want to briefly explain what CPT is. The CPT is a data-driven approach that increases statistical power while controlling for Type I errors across multiple comparisons—exactly what we need when analyzing fixations across the time course.

The clustering procedure involves three main steps:

1\. Cluster Formation: With our data, a multilevel logistic models is conducted for every data point (condition by time). Adjacent data points that surpass the mass univariate significance threshold (e.g., p \< .05) are combined into clusters. The cluster-level statistic, typically the sum of the t-values (or F-values) within the cluster, is computed. By clustering adjacent significant data points, this step accounts for autocorrelation by considering temporal dependencies rather than treating each data point as independent.

2\. Null Distribution Creation: A surrogate null distribution is generated by randomly permuting the conditions within subjects. This randomization is repeated n times (here 1000), and the cluster-level statistic is computed for each permutation. This step addresses multiple comparisons by constructing a distribution of cluster statistics under the null hypothesis, ensuring that family-wise error rates (FWER) are controlled.

3\. Significance Testing: The cluster-level statistic from the observed (real) comparison is compared to the null distribution. Clusters with statistics falling in the highest or lowest 2.5% of the null distribution are considered significant (e.g., *p* \< 0.05).

To preform CPT, we will load in the the `permutaes` [@permutes], `permuco` [@permuco], and [@foreach] packages in R so we can use the `cluster.glmer`() function to run a cluster permutation model with our `gaze_sub_id` dataset where each row in `Looks` denotes whether the Area of Interest (IA) was fixated, with values of zero (not fixated) or one (fixated).

Below is sample code to perform multilevel CPA in R.

# Discussion

Webcam eye-tracking is a relatively nascent technology, and as such, there is limited guidance available for researchers. To ameliorate this, we created a tutorial to assist new users of webcam eye-tracking in analyzing their data, using some of the best practices laid out in other work (e.g., @bramlett2024 . To further facilitate this process, we created the `webgazeR` package, which contains several helper functions designed to streamline data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

In this tutorial, we covered the basic steps of running a VWP experiment online using webcam-based eye-tracking. We highlighted these steps by using data from a cross-linguistic VWP looking at competitive processes in L2 speakers of Spanish. Specifically, we attempted to replicate the experiment by @sarrett2022 where they observed within- and cross-linguistic competition using carefully crafted materials.

While the main purpose of this tutorial was to highlight the steps needed to analyze webcam eye-tracking data, replicating @sarrett2022 allowed us to not only assess whether competition can be found in a spoken word recognition VWP experiment online (one of the first studies to do so), but also provide insight in how to run VWP studies online and the issues associated with it.

Turning first to our conceptual replication attempt, the findings are very encouraging. We demonstrated competition effects both within (Spanish-Spanish condition) and across languages (Spanish-English condition), paralleling what Sarrett found. However, there are some important differences between our studies worth highlighting.

First, while Sarrett used a non-linear curve-fitting approach to examine the time course of competition, we used a cluster-based permutation approach. This methodological difference meant we could not address similar questions, though the overall temporal pattern of findings is strikingly similar. Second, we employed a truncated stimulus set, with half the number of trials (250 vs. 450). While the number of trials is smaller than the original study, the number of trials is much larger than any of the other webcam online studies to date. Even with the fewer number of trials, we were able to obersve a similar pattern of competition in both conditions. Third, we collected all our data on Prolific with a limited set of filters, whereas Sarrett recruited students from a Spanish college course and used the LexTALE-Spanish assessment to evaluate Spanish proficiency. Lastly, Sarrett's sample consisted of adult L2 learners, whereas our sample included a broader range of L2 speakers with limited checks on their language abilities.The filters available on Prolific only allowed us to screen for native language and experience with another language, limiting our ability to refine participant selection further.

While we do not wish to downplay our findings, a more systematic study is needed to ensure their generalizability. Nonetheless, our findings underscore the potential of webcam-based eye-tracking for investigating competition effects in L2 users. We encourage researchers to continue exploring competitive processes in L2 learners.

## Limitations

While the above suggests that webcam eye-tracking is a promising avenue for language research, there are some issues that we ran into that need to be addressed. One issue that plauges webcam eye-tracking is data loss due to poor calibration. In our study, we had to throw out \~40% of our data due to poor calibration. Other studies have shown numbers much higher (e.g.,) and lower (Yanina). Given this it is still an open question as to what contributes to better vs. poor data quality in webcam eye-tracking. To this end, we included an assessment after the VWP that included questions on the participants’ experimental set-ups and overall experiences with the eye-tracking experiment. All questions are included \@tbl-question.

### Poor vs. Good calibrators

In our experimental design, participants were branched based on whether they successfully completed the experiment or failed calibration at any point. Table 2 highlights the comparisons between good and poor calibrators. For the sake of brevity, we do not include responses to all questions. You can look at all the responses here. However, two key differences emerge that may provide insight into factors influencing successful calibration.

One notable difference is the type of webcam used. Participants who failed calibration predominantly reported using built-in webcams, whereas those who successfully calibrated reported using a variety of external webcams. This suggests that built-in webcams may not provide sufficient resolution for calibration in the experiment. @slim2023 performed some correlations looking at calibration score and webcam quality and noticed that high frame rate correlated with a calibration scores.

Another difference lies in the participants' environmental setup. Individuals who failed calibration were more likely to be in environments with natural light. Since natural light is known to interfere with eye-tracking, it may have contributed to their inability to calibrate successfully.

We did not notice any other differences between those that successful calibrated vs. those who did not. For researchers wanting to use webcam eye-tracking, they should try to make sure participants are in rooms without natural light, and use good web cameras. While we tried to emphasize this in our instructional videos, more explicit instruction may be needed. An avenue for research research would be to compare lab based webcam eye-tracking to online based webcam eye tracking to see if control of the environment can produce better results.

It is important to note here that Gorilla, the experimental platform, we used uses webgazer.JS to perform it’s eye tracking. It is unclear if poor calibration results from the noise introduced by participant's environment/equipment or if it is a function of the method itself, or both. We have listed some equipment and enviroemntal factors that may contribite to the poor performance; however it could be the algorthmy itself that is poor. There are other experimental platforms out there that use different eye-tracking ML algorithms to perform webcam eye-tracking (e.g., labvanced; XXX). In labanced they aslo use head motion tracking that measures the distance of the participant in front he screen to ensure head movement is restricted to an acceptable range. Together this might make for a better eye-tracking experience with less data thrown out. This should be investigated further. 

**Generalizability to Other Platforms** In this study, we demonstrated how to analyze data from a Gorilla experiment using WebGazer.js. While we were unable to validate this pipeline on other experimental platforms, such as PCIbex (Zehr & Schwarz, 2014) or jsPsych (de Leeuw et al.), we believe that this basic pipeline will generalize to those platforms, as WebGazer.js underlies them all and provides consistent output. We encourage researchers to test this pipeline in their own studies and report any issues on our GitHub repository. We are committed to continuing improvements to **webgazeR**, ensuring that users can effectively analyze webcam eye-tracking data with our package.

**Power**

While we successfully demonstrated competition effects similar to Sarrett’s study, we did not conduct an a priori power analysis to determine the smallest effect size of interest. Some recommendations suggest running twice the number of participants from the original sample or powering the study to detect an effect size half as large as the original (Slim). We attempted to double the sample size but were unable to recruit enough participants through Prolific. Our sample size is similar to the lab based studies and the effects are very similar. 

We strongly urge researchers to perform power analyses and justify their sample sizes (Lakens). While tools like G\*Power are available for this purpose, we recommend power simulations using Monte Carlo methods on pilot or sample data (Yanina, Slim). Several excellent R packages, such as **mixedPower**, make such simulations straightforward and accessible.

## Recommendations

Based on our findings and limitations, we propose the following recommendations for researchers conducting webcam-based eye-tracking studies:

1.  **Prioritize External Webcams\
    **Our data showed that participants using external webcams had significantly better calibration success compared to those relying on built-in webcams. External webcams generally provide higher resolution and frame rates, which are critical for accurate eye-tracking. Researchers should encourage participants to use external webcams whenever possible.

2.  **Optimize Environmental Conditions\
    **Natural light was a common factor in environments where calibration failed. Researchers should advise participants to conduct experiments in rooms with controlled lighting—ideally, artificial lighting with minimal glare or shadows—to reduce interference with eye-tracking accuracy.

3.  **Conduct A Priori Power Analysis and Simulations\
    **To ensure adequate statistical power, researchers should conduct a priori power analyses either via GUI like GPower or use perform Monte Carlo simulations on pilot data. This step is particularly important for online studies, where sample variability can be higher than in controlled lab environments. Tools like **G\*Power** and R packages such as **mixedPower** can simplify these calculations.

4.  **Collect Detailed Post-Experiment Feedback\
    **Including post-experiment questionnaires about participants' setups (e.g., webcam type, browser, lighting conditions) can provide valuable insights into calibration success factors. These data can help refine participant instructions and inclusion criteria for future studies.

By adhering to these recommendations, researchers can enhance the reliability and generalizability of their webcam eye-tracking studies, ensuring the potential of this technology is fully realized.

## Conclusions

This work highlighted the steps required to process webcam eye-tracking data collected via Gorilla, showcasing the potential of webcam-based eye-tracking for robust psycholinguistic experimentation. With a standarized pipeline for processing eye-tracking data we hope we have given researchers a clear path forward when collecting and analyze webcam eye-tracking data.

Moreoever, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of conducting high-quality online experiments, paving the way for future research to address more nuanced questions about L2 processing and language comprehension more broadly. Additionally, further refinement of webcam eye-tracking methodologies could enhance data precision and extend their applicability to more complex experimental designs. This is an exciting time for eye-tracking research, with its boundaries continuously expanding. We eagerly anticipate the advancements and possibilities that the future of webcam eye-tracking will bring.
